# AutoRotation

# Prerequisites

BlueStacks https://www.bluestacks.com/ 

AutoHotKey https://www.autohotkey.com/ - Current Version

# Installation

Just need to have all of the files downloaded in the same folder.

In Bluestacks you will need to set up your hotkeys, see following for examples:

![Hotkey Placement](images/hotkey1.PNG?raw=true "Hotkeys")

![Hotkey Placement](images/hotkey2.PNG?raw=true "Hotkeys")

When you are ready open blitz screen and select your last saved squad (i.e. 28/28).  Then run the appropriate script.  Either **fullBlitz** for one rotation, or  **fullBlitzOvernight** for 4 rotations in a row.

# Optional Features
## Email Notificaiton 
I have the script email me when errors occur as well as a summary of the blitz rotation (Wins / Losses, Duration, Score before and after).  This is entirely optional, if you wish to remove it just remove or comment our all calls to the **sendEmailNotification** function
